# expo-firebase-analytics

> Source code for the deprecated expo-firebase-analytics package. See our [Using Firebase](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-firebase/) guide for how to use the Firebase JS SDK or React Native Firebase directly. If you still use this package, see our [Migration Guide](https://expo.fyi/firebase-migration-guide) for help upgrading.

`expo-firebase-analytics` enables the use of native Google Analytics for Firebase. Google Analytics for Firebase is a free app measurement solution that provides insight on app usage and user engagement.
